    <p style="color: white;">12:7. And there was a great battle in heaven: Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon fought, and his angels. <br> <br>

        12:8. And they prevailed not: neither was their place found any more in heaven. <br> <br>
        
        12:9. And that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, who seduceth the whole world. And he was cast unto the earth: and his angels were thrown down with him.</p>
